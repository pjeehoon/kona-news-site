      "title": "“세계 최강 여성” 칭호, 하루 만에 박탈…이유는?",
      "content": "인스타그램 @officialstrongmangames 캡처\n미국의 한 여성이 ‘세계 최강 여성’ 칭호를 받은 지 하루 만에 타이틀을 박탈당했다. 대회에서 1등을 차지한 이 여성은 트랜스젠더임이 밝혀져 실격 처리됐다.\n지난 25일(현지시간) 영국 데일리메일 등 외신에 따르면 대회 주최 측은 미국인 제이미 부커가 “생물학적 남성”이라며 규칙 위반으로 부커의 1등 타이틀을 박탈했다.\n대회 주최 측은 공식 성명서에 “생물학적으로는 남성이지만 현재는 자신을 여성으로 규정하는 선수가 여성 부문 대회에 참가했다”고 밝혔다.\n주최 측은 대회가 열리기 전 이 사실을 알지 못했다. 부커는 키 198cm, 체중 약 180kg으로 개인 트레이너로 일하고 있다.\n주최 측은 “(부커가 트랜스젠더 여성이라는) 사실을 미리 알았다면 경기에 출전할 수 없었을 것”이라고 했다.\n세계 최강 여성 대회에서 세 번 우승한 레베카 로버츠는 “여성 스포츠를 보호하자”며 “트랜스젠더에 대한 증오심을 품고 있지 않지만, 남성으로 태어난 트랜스젠더 여성은 여성 부문에서 함께 경쟁할 수 없다”고 주장했다.\n해당 논란에 대해 부커는 대회가 끝난 후 소셜미디어(SNS)에 “경기에 출전한 여러분은 정말 멋진 여성들”이라며 “이후 어디에서 경쟁을 펼치게 될지 모르겠지만 모두에게 감사하다”고 말했다.",
